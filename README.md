# ðŸŽ² Gaussian Naive Bayes in Python
## About The Project
This is an implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier in Jupyter notebook along with all the probability background necessary. It was done as as project in CÃ©gÃ©p.

## Abstract
We use a guassian naive bayes classifier and apply it to the iris dataset.
The classifier takes in iris dimension data and returns the top n probabilities for that iris being in a certain class. It does so by counting the number of times each dimension appears in each class and applying statistical methods to guess the probability of a class given an iris. The classifer gets an accuracy range between 88% - 98%.
