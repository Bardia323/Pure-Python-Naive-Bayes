# ðŸ§® Gaussian Naive Bayes in Python
## About The Project
This is an implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier in Jupyter notebook along with all the probability background necessary. It was done as as project in CÃ©gÃ©p.

## Abstract
We use a guassian naive bayes classifier and apply it to the iris dataset.
The classifier takes in words and returns the top n probabilities for that word being in a certain class. It does so by counting the number of times each class appears in each word and applying statistical methods to guess the probability of a word given a class. The classifer gets an accuracy range between 88% - 98%.
